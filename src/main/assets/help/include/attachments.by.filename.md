## Attachments by filename

---

If specified, only attachments with filenames matching the specified pattern will be downloaded. Leave blank to download all attachments.

By default, filename patterns are case-sensitive. To ignore case, start the pattern with `!`.

This setting takes a glob pattern. For example, `*.zip` will download ZIP files only.
