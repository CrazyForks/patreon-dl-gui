## Images by filename

---

If specified, only images with filenames matching the specified pattern will be downloaded. Leave blank to download all images.

By default, filename patterns are case-sensitive. To ignore case, start the pattern with `!`.

This setting takes a glob pattern. For example, `*.{gif,jpg,jpeg}` will download JPEGs and GIFs only.
