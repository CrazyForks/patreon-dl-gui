## Audio by filename

---

If specified, only audio items with filenames matching the specified pattern will be downloaded. Leave blank to download all audio files.

By default, filename patterns are case-sensitive. To ignore case, start the pattern with `!`.

This setting takes a glob pattern. For example, `*.wav` will download WAV files only.
